a. Dealer has two programs; one to draw cards from a deck and list out the specific cards, and another to play Blackjack, a game that makes the user draw to compete with the dealer up to 21.

b. As a dealer, you can choose to shuffle a deck of cards, and deal any number of them to up to fifty two players, either through the command line or GUI. As a dealer, you know which cards remain in the deck and what each player drew. 

As a blackjack player, you can play a game of Blackjack with a dealer by betting points, either through the command line or GUI. You can hit or stand every turn. 

c. The software runs on both GUI and command line. The program displays options to shuffle and disperse cards in Dealer, and gives options to bet, hit and stand in Blackjack.

d. As a game user I can press a "Quit" button or type quit at the command line so that I can quit the current game when done.
As a dealer I can deal different decks, such as a 54 card deck that includes two jokers, so that different games can be made.
As a game user I can press a "Blackjack" button or type 3 in the first query so that I can play a game of blackjack. 

e. The README.md clearly describes what the project is intended to do. It explains how to run the application and how the application works.Something that can be added is an explanation of how the blackjack class is implemented using the dealer class. 




f. An assessment of the current state of the build.xml file if applicable, or if the project has been converted to Maven or Gradle, note this.
If it’s based on Ant, Are there targets that need descriptions? Is there old legacy JWS stuff that needs to be removed? (More on this below).
It it’s based on Maven or Gradle, is there sufficient documentation in the README.md that someone new to those tools has the information they need to get started?

(g) (20 pts) An assessment of the current “issues”. Are there enough issues that you could earn 1000 points by working on this project? Are the issues clear in terms of what the expectations are?

(h) (20 pts) A list of additional issues that you may have added, if any. For each, a link to the issue is good enough.

(i) (100 pts) Most important: an assessment of the actual code. Write a bit about how the code is organized. Are the purposes of the classes, and their methods clear? Is it obvious how the classes relate to one another? Is the code easy to read and understand? If you had to give someone else that was going to work on the code just “one screenful of text” to help that programmer get up to speed quickly, what information would you convey?

(j) (40 pts) Related to code quality, but factored out into a separate issue because it is so important: how is the test coverage? Are there JUnit tests at all? If so, how much of the project is covered by testing? Are there opportunities to expand test coverage, and if so, how would you go about it?
